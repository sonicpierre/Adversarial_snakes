# Adversarial snake player

This project is an adaptation of Patrick Loeber's work. Here the known game snake can be played with a number n of snakes and a number n of apples. It is possible to see how the snakes interact with each other when they are trained separately or together.

It is possible to compare different models to see which ones perform best and respond to changing environments.
